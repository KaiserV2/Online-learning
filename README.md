# Online-learning
Includes all online learning (EC 500) datasets and code.

The generate_data.py generates two datasets respectively. 
Both datasets contains 10 bandits (path) loss (latency). The first five and the latter five are of the same mean but different variations.

Dataset 1: Each bandit has mean value static.
Dataset 2: Each bandit has mean value dynamic (in tatal 4 changes).

The mean of the above 2 datasets are expected to be the same.
